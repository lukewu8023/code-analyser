The provided code does not contain any methods, it's a simple class with two fields. Therefore, it's not possible to provide information about methods, parameters, invoked methods, or method descriptions. However, the package name and class name can be extracted.

Here is the JSON string for the available information:

```json
{
  "package_name": "com.example.demo.entity",
  "class_name": "Identifier"

```
The provided code does not contain any methods, it's a simple class with a single attribute. Therefore, the information about methods, parameters, interface, invoked methods, and method description cannot be extracted. However, the package name and class name can be extracted. Here is the JSON string for the available information:

```json

The given code is an enumeration in Java, not a class. It does not contain any methods, but it does contain a constructor. Here is the information extracted from the code:

1) The package name of the class is "com.example.demo.entity".
2) The class name is "EnumType".
3) There are no methods in this enumeration. There is only a constructor.
4) The parameters of the constructor are "String tableName" and "String fieldName".
5) No, it is not a method in an interface. It is a constructor in an enumeration.
6) The constructor is not invoking any methods. It is only assigning values to the instance variables "tableName" and "fieldName".
7) The constructor "EnumType(String tableName, String fieldName)" is used to create an instance of the enumeration. It takes two parameters: a string for the table name and a string for the field name. These values are then assigned to the instance variables "tableName" and "fieldName".

Here is the JSON string:

```json
{
  "method_name": "",
  "package_name": "com.example.demo.entity",
  "class_name": "EnumType",
  "parameters": ["String tableName", "String fieldName"],
  "is_interface": false,
  "invoked_methods": [],
  "method_desc": "The constructor 'EnumType(String tableName, String fieldName)' is used to create an instance of the enumeration. It takes two parameters: a string for the table name and a string for the field name. These values are then assigned to the instance variables 'tableName' and 'fieldName'."
}
```
The provided code does not contain any methods, it's a simple Java class with three private fields and using Lombok annotations to generate getter, setter and constructor methods. Therefore, the information requested such as method names, parameters, whether it's an interface, invoked methods, and method descriptions cannot be extracted from this code. 

However, based on the available information, a partial JSON can be constructed as follows:

```json
{
  "package_name": "com.example.demo.entity",
  "class_name": "Attribute",
  "is_interface": false
}
```

Please provide a Java class with methods to extract the requested information.
The provided code is a simple Java class definition using Lombok annotations. It does not contain any methods, so most of the requested information cannot be extracted. However, the package name and class name can be identified.

Here is the JSON string for the available information:

```json
{
  "package_name": "com.example.demo.entity",
  "class_name": "Concept"
}
```

Please note that Lombok's @Getter and @Setter annotations automatically generate getter and setter methods for the class fields during compile time. However, these methods are not explicitly defined in the provided code, so they are not included in the JSON string.

The output JSON string based on the provided Java code would be:

```json
{
  "method_name": "processVin",
  "package_name": "com.example.demo.controller",
  "class_name": "ProcessController",
  "parameters": [],
  "is_interface": false,

  "method_desc": "This method is a GET mapping method in the ProcessController class. It does not take any parameters. It invokes the 'link' method of the 'process' object of the 'Process' class. The method returns a Response object which is the result of the 'link' method of the 'process' object."
}
```

Explanation:
1) The package name of the class is "com.example.demo.controller".
2) The class name is "ProcessController".
3) There is one method in the class, named "processVin".
4) The method "processVin" does not have any parameters.
5) This is not a method in an interface.
6) The method "processVin" is invoking the "link" method of the "process" object of the "Process" class.
7) The method "processVin" is a GET mapping method in the ProcessController class. It does not take any parameters. It invokes the 'link' method of the 'process' object of the 'Process' class. The method returns a Response object which is the result of the 'link' method of the 'process' object.
The provided code is a simple Java class with no methods, only fields. Therefore, the information you're asking for cannot be extracted from this code. However, I can provide the information that can be extracted from this code:

1) The package name of the class is "com.example.demo.model".
2) The class name is "DCA".
3) There are no methods in this class.
4) There are no parameters of method because there are no methods.
5) It is not a method in an interface because there are no methods.
6) There are no invoked methods this method is invoking in the method body because there are no methods.
7) There is no description of single method because there are no methods.

The JSON string with the above information would look like this:

```json
{
  "package_name": "com.example.demo.model",
  "class_name": "DCA",
  "methods": []
}
```

In this JSON, "methods" is an empty array because there are no methods in the class. If there were methods, each method would be represented as an object in this array.
The provided code does not contain any methods, it only contains two private variables. Therefore, it's not possible to provide information about methods, parameters, invoked methods, or method descriptions. However, the package name and class name can be extracted.

The provided code does not contain any methods, it is a simple Java class with three private fields and getter and setter methods for these fields provided by the Lombok library. Therefore, the information requested in points 3 to 7 cannot be extracted from this code. 

However, the information for points 1 and 2 can be extracted and represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
